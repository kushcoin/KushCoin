KushCoin 2014

1.Install the package included.(kushcoin-0.8.6-win32-setup)

Using windows file explorer (or equal) go to the "Application Data" file on your hard drive.

*Almost always this can be done by simply typing
%appdata% in the file explorer address bar.

There you will insert the included file "kushcoin.conf".

Now you can start up KushCoin and it should automatically find at least one peer to connect too :)

The "kushcoin.conf" file is where you can make edits to set up growing etc., there is a lot of info in the file that is appended by the # sign so that it doesnt get processed by the system, it can be opened in notepad, and read normally.

KushCoin's port is 9385, so open that up on your firewall.
