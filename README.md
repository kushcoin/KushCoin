####Qucik Help & Install Guide

Windows-

1.Install the package 

included.(kushcoin-0.8.6-win32-setup the "lite" setup is a easy wallet setup, the full package has kushcoind etc.)

Using windows file explorer (or equal) go to the 

"Application Data" file on your hard drive.

*Almost always this can be done by simply typing
%appdata% in the file explorer address bar.

There you will insert the included file 

"kushcoin.conf".

Now you can start up KushCoin and it should 

automatically find at least one peer to connect too :)

The "kushcoin.conf" file is where you can make edits to 

set up growing etc., there is a lot of info in the file 

that is appended by the # sign so that it doesnt get 

processed by the system, it can be opened in notepad, 

and read normally.
